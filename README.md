# Guard-Sass

guard-sass compiles or validates your sass (and scss) files automatically when changed.

## Install

You will need to have [guard](http://github.com/guard/guard) to continue, so install it now!

Install the gem with:

    gem install guard-sass

Add it to your Gemfile:

    gem 'guard-sass'

And finally add a basic setup to your Guardfile with:

    guard init sass

## Usage

Please read the [Guard usage documentation](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme).

## Guardfile

guard-sass can be adapted to all kind of projects. Please read the
[Guard documentation](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for more information about the Guardfile DSL.

### Ruby project

In a Ruby project you want to configure your input and output directories.

```ruby
guard 'sass', :input => 'sass', :output => 'styles'
```

If your output directory is the same as the input directory, you can simply skip it:

```ruby
guard 'sass', :input => 'styles'
```

### Rails app with the asset pipeline

With the introduction of the [asset pipeline](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html)
in Rails 3.1 there is no need to compile your Sass stylesheets with this Guard. However if you
like to have instant validation feedback (preferably with a Growl notification) directly after
you save a change, then you may want still use this Guard and just skip the generation of the
output file:

```ruby
guard 'sass', :input => 'app/assets/stylesheets', :noop => true
```

This give you a faster compilation feedback compared to making a subsequent request to your
Rails application. If you just want to be notified when an error occurs you can hide the
success compilation message:

```ruby
guard 'sass', :input => 'app/assets/stylesheets', :noop => true, :hide_success => true
```

### Rails app without the asset pipeline

Without the asset pipeline you just define an input and output directory like within a normal Ruby project:

```ruby
guard 'sass', :input => 'app/stylesheets', :output => 'public/stylesheets'
```

## Options

There following options can be passed to guard-sass:

```ruby
:input => 'sass'                    # Relative path to the input directory.
                                    # A suffix `/(.+\.s[ac]ss)` will be added to this option.
                                    # default: nil

:output => 'css'                    # Relative path to the output directory.
                                    # default: 'css' or the :input option when supplied

:notification => false              # Whether to display success and error notifications after finished.
                                    # default: true

:hide_success => true               # Disable successful compilation messages.
                                    # default: false

:shallow => true                    # Do not create nested output directories.
                                    # default: false

:style => :nested                   # Controls the output style.
                                    # Accepted options are :nested, :compact, :compressed and :expanded
                                    # default: :nested

:load_paths => ['sass/partials']    # Paths for sass to find imported sass files from.
                                    # default: all directories under current

:noop => true                       # No operation: Do not write output file
                                    # default: false

:debug_info_ => true                # File and line number info for FireSass.
                                    # default: false
```

### Output short notation

guard-sass also has a short notation like [guard-coffeescript][gcs], this let's you define
an input folder (with an optional output folder) and the watcher is defined for you.

```ruby
guard 'sass', :input => 'sass', :output => 'styles'
# or
guard 'sass', :input => 'stylesheets'
```

These are equivalent to

```ruby
guard 'sass', :output => 'styles' do
  watch %r{^sass/(.+\.s[ac]ss)$}
end

guard 'sass' do
  watch %r{^stylesheets/(.+\.s[ac]ss)$}
end
```

### Nested directories

The Guard detects by default nested directories and creates these within the output directory.
The detection is based on the match of the watch regular expression:

A file

```bash
/app/stylesheets/form/button.sass
```

that has been detected by the watch

```ruby
watch(%r{^app/stylesheets/(.+\.s[ac]ss)$})
```

with an output directory of

```ruby
:output => 'public/stylesheets'
```

will be compiled to

```bash
public/stylesheets/form/button.css
```

Note the parenthesis around the `.+\.s[ac]ss`. This enables guard-sass to place the full
path that was matched inside the parenthesis into the proper output directory.

This behavior can be switched off by passing the option `:shallow => true` to the Guard, so that
all stylesheets will be compiled directly to the output directory.

Since this Guard is very close to [guard-coffeescript](http://github.com/netzpirat/guard-coffeescript),
some features have been incorporated into guard-sass.
